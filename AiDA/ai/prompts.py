"""

ANALYZE_FUNCTION_PROMPT = BASE_PROMPT + """
Analyze the provided function and its context from a game. Produce a detailed, structured report covering these critical points for a cheat developer. Explain each section clearly.

1.  **High-Level Purpose:** A single, concise sentence explaining what this function likely does in the game.
    *Example: "This function likely calculates the damage to apply to a player when they are hit by a projectile."*

2.  **Detailed Logic Flow:** A bulleted list detailing the step-by-step logic. Explain complex calculations, important conditional checks, loops, and interactions with game objects.
    *Example: "- Checks if the target object at [RCX+0x120] is valid. - Reads the target's current health from offset 0x1A8. - Subtracts the incoming damage amount, passed in RDX."*

3.  **Function Inputs (Arguments) & Return Value:** Identify likely arguments and the return value. For 64-bit, arguments are often in registers RCX, RDX, R8, R9, then the stack. The return value is usually in RAX. Guess their C++ types (e.g., `ACharacter*`, `FVector`, `float`, `bool`) and their purpose.
    *Example: "- RCX (Argument 1): Likely a pointer to the player or entity being damaged (e.g., `ACharacter* this`). - RDX (Argument 2): The amount of damage to apply (e.g., `float damage_amount`). - RAX (Return Value): The final calculated damage, or perhaps the remaining health (e.g., `float final_damage`)."*

4.  **Identified Pattern/Role:** Name the programming pattern (e.g., virtual function call, singleton access, event callback) and its specific role in the game.
    *Example: "This is a virtual function override for `TakeDamage`, acting as the primary Player Damage Handler."*

5.  **Game Hacking Opportunities:** A bulleted list of actionable cheating strategies. Be specific and explain the goal.
    *   **Hooking (Function Interception):** What could be achieved by intercepting this function?
        *Example: "God Mode: Hook this function and make it return 0 to prevent any damage from being applied."*
        *Example: "ESP/Radar: Hook to log the entity pointers passed in RCX to track all entities taking damage."*
    *   **Memory-Writing (Direct Modification):** What member variables could be modified for a cheat?
        *Example: "Unlimited Health: The `health` member at offset `[RCX+0x1A8]` could be periodically written with its max value."*
    *   **Information Disclosure:** What valuable data can be read from memory?
        *Example: "Player Pointer: The return value in RAX could be read to get a pointer to the local player object, which is essential for many cheats."*

GENERATE_STRUCT_PROMPT = BASE_PROMPT + """
You are an expert reverse engineer specializing in C++ game engines. Your task is to analyze the provided function's memory accesses to reconstruct the C++ class or struct it manipulates.

**Analysis Steps:**
1.  **Determine Function Role:** First, identify if this function is a class method (operating on `this`), a constructor, or a static/global utility function. The base pointer for member access will change depending on the role.
2.  **Identify Base Pointer:** Find the register that acts as the base pointer for member accesses (e.g., `RCX` for a `this` pointer, or a stack pointer for a locally constructed object).
3.  **Reconstruct the Struct:**
    - Identify all member variables accessed via offsets from the base pointer.
    - **Use IDA's specific integer types (`__int8`, `__int16`, `__int32`, `__int64`) instead of standard C types.** This is critical for the parser.
    - Deduce the data type (`float`, `bool`, `FVector*`, `UObject*`, etc.) and a descriptive name for each member.
    - Identify the VTable by looking for virtual function calls (e.g., `call qword ptr [rax+1B8h]`). The VTable is almost always the first member at offset `0x0`.
    - **CRITICAL: You MUST account for padding.** If there is a gap between members, you MUST fill it with a `char pad_...[size];` member. This is the most common reason for parsing failure.
4.  **Final Output:**
    - Return the result as a single, clean C++ struct definition inside a markdown code block.
    - The struct name should be a plausible PascalCase name based on the function's context.
    - Add comments with the byte offset for every member, starting at `0x0`.
    - **If you cannot confidently identify a struct**, do not invent one. Instead, return a markdown block explaining the memory operations you observe (e.g., "This function appears to construct a temporary string object on the stack.").

**Good Example (Correct Padding & VTable):**
```cpp
struct APlayerCharacter
{{
    __int64 VTable;       // 0x0000
    char pad_0008[0x88];  // 0x0008
    __int32 Health;       // 0x0090
    __int32 MaxHealth;    // 0x0094
    __int64 MovementComponent; // 0x0098
}};

LOCATE_GLOBAL_POINTER_PROMPT = BASE_PROMPT + """
You are an expert in x86-64 assembly, specifically for Unreal Engine games.
Your task is to analyze the provided function to find the absolute address of the global pointer for `{target_name}`.

There are two primary patterns for this. Analyze the function for both.

**Pattern A: Direct RIP-Relative Access**
This is common in games without pointer protection. The pointer is loaded in a single instruction.
1. Look for a `LEA` or `MOV` instruction that loads a global pointer.
   - Example: `LEA RCX, [rip+0x1234567]`
   - Example: `MOV RAX, [rip+0xABCDEF0]`
2. The result of this instruction is the address of the global pointer itself (e.g., a `UWorld**`).
3. If you find this pattern, calculate the absolute address: `FinalAddress = InstructionAddress + InstructionSize + Displacement`.
   - For most relevant instructions, `InstructionSize` is 7.

**Pattern B: Obfuscated/Encrypted Access (Very Common)**
This is used in most modern games. The pointer is decrypted by a function call.
1. Look for a `CALL` to a small, non-descript function.
2. Immediately before this `CALL`, look for a `LEA` or `MOV` instruction that loads a RIP-relative address into the first argument register (RCX, RDI). This address points to the *encrypted* `{target_name}` data.
   - Example:
     ```assembly
     .text:00000001412B4A3D    LEA   RCX, [rip+0x9A8B43C]  ; <-- This instruction is the key. It loads the address of the encrypted data.
     .text:00000001412B4A44    CALL  sub_140B8A090          ; <-- This is the decryption stub. It returns the real pointer in RAX.
     ```
3. The instruction that loads the address of the encrypted data is the one that reveals the location.
4. Calculate the absolute address of that data using the `LEA`/`MOV` instruction: `FinalAddress = InstructionAddress + InstructionSize + Displacement`.

**Your Task:**
1. Analyze the decompiled code and find the single instruction (`LEA` or `MOV`) that fits either **Pattern A** or **Pattern B** to locate the `{target_name}` data.
2. Calculate the final, absolute address of the `{target_name}` pointer data.
3. **Return ONLY the final calculated absolute address.** For example: `0x14AD3FE80`.
4. If you cannot determine the address with high confidence from either pattern, return the single word "None".
